#+TITLE: The Most Dangerous Minor Mode

The Most Dangerous Minor Mode, as the name says, is a particularly
dangerous Emacs minor mode.  It’s inspired by the website “the most
dangerous writing app”.

If you don’t type at least one key every ~tmd-timeout~, (by default 5
seconds) the whole buffer will be deleted (the narrowing will be
respected).

You can enable and toggle it with =M-x tmd-minor-mode RET=.

It doesn’t delete the undo history, this is probably a bug ;)
